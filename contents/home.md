# KYDW Undergraduate Research Team: Chasing Dreams in Research and Forging Ahead

In the vast cosmos of scientific research, the KYDW Undergraduate Research Team is like a rising star, writing its own legendary chapter with astonishing speed and dazzling brilliance. Since its establishment a year and a half ago, we have been driven by a passion for exploring the unknown and an unyielding pursuit of excellence. We have braved numerous challenges and achieved remarkable and fruitful results.

## I. Outstanding Achievements, Testimony of Strength

We are well aware that the path of scientific research is never smooth. Only with solid professional knowledge, keen insight, and tenacious perseverance can we stand out in fierce competition. The members of the KYDW team have achieved this with their excellent qualities, using high-quality academic achievements to win honor and recognition for the group.

In the field of international top conferences, we have successfully overcome difficulties and won 1 CCF A-class conference paper. This is not only a high affirmation of our research direction and results, but also the best proof of the group's strength. As an authoritative event in the field of computer science, the CCF A-class conference gathers top global scientific research talents and cutting-edge research results. Being able to publish a paper here means that our research level has reached the international first-class level. In addition, 1 MICCAI conference paper has also been accepted in advance, which once again shows our strong strength and unique insights in the relevant field.

In terms of journal papers, we have achieved brilliant results. The publication of 5 first-tier papers (including 2 top papers) fully shows the group's excellent performance in the depth and breadth of academic research. These papers cover several key research directions, not only providing new ideas and methods for the development of related fields, but also further enhancing the group's fame and influence in the academic community. The 2 second-tier papers also condense the hard work and wisdom of the members, and they explore important issues from different angles, contributing to the diversified development of academic research.

At present, we have 2 papers in the rebuttal stage, which means that we are only one step away from top journals. At the same time, 7 SCI papers are being submitted intensively. These papers cover the group's latest research results and innovative views. We firmly believe that with the unremitting efforts and rigorous attitude of the members, these papers will surely add more brilliance to the group's scientific research achievements.

## II. Teamwork, Cohesion of Strength

The success of the KYDW Undergraduate Research Team is inseparable from the hard work and selfless dedication of every member. We are a vibrant and united team. Members come from different professional backgrounds, but gather together because of the common dream of scientific research. In daily research, everyone fully plays their professional advantages, learns from each other, supports each other, and forms a good academic atmosphere and team culture.

The team regularly holds academic exchanges. Members actively share their research progress, problems encountered, and solutions. Through the collision of ideas, new inspiration and creativity are constantly stimulated. When facing complex scientific research problems, everyone works together to overcome difficulties. This spirit of teamwork not only allows the group to steadily move forward on the road of scientific research, but also allows each member to grow and progress in cooperation.

In addition, the team has also received careful guidance from many excellent mentors. With rich research experience and profound academic attainments, the mentors have provided valuable direction and suggestions for the development of the group. Under their leadership, we can keep pace with the academic frontier, continuously expand our research vision, and improve our research level.

## III. Looking to the Future, Forging Ahead

The past year and a half has been a golden period of rapid development for the KYDW Undergraduate Research Team. We have achieved remarkable results in the field of scientific research. However, we are well aware that these achievements are only the starting point of our scientific research journey. The road ahead is still long and full of challenges.

Looking to the future, we will continue to keep our original intention, and devote ourselves to the scientific research cause with more enthusiasm and a more rigorous attitude. We will further deepen our research direction, actively explore new research fields and methods, and strive to make louder voices on the international top academic stage. At the same time, we will also focus on team building, attract more outstanding undergraduates to join our team, and cultivate more scientific research talents with innovative spirit and research ability.

We believe that with the unremitting efforts of team members, the careful guidance of mentors, and the strong support of schools and society, the KYDW Undergraduate Research Team will surely create more brilliance on the road of scientific research in the future and make greater contributions to promoting academic development and scientific and technological progress.

Welcome to follow the KYDW Undergraduate Research Team. Let's join hands and witness the realization of more scientific research dreams together!
